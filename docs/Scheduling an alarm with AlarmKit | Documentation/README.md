# Scheduling an alarm with AlarmKit

Create prominent alerts at specified dates for your iOS app.

## Overview

An alarm is an alert that presents at a pre-determined time based on a schedule or after a countdown. 
It overrides both a device's focus and silent mode, if necessary.

This sample project uses AlarmKit to create and manage different types of alarms. 
In this app people can create and manage:

- **One-time alarms** which alert only once at a specified time in the future.
- **Repeating alarms** which alert with a weekly cadence.
- **Timers** which alert after a countdown, and start immediately.

This project also includes a widget extension for setting up the custom countdown Live Activity associated with an alarm.
